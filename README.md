# COVID-19 Tracker
The application aims to show some data about covid-19 pandemic in 192 countries from around the globe (these data such as the number of people confirmed / died / recovered).
This website gives the privilege to do the following:
- You can track the data about each country separately.
- You can create an account to add some countries to "favorites" section.
I may add some other features in the future ISA.

The front-end part was developed using vanilla #JavaScript, and #bootstrap5 .I really enjoyed working with #nodejs in developing the required #restfulapis for back-end of the application. Also I used #MongoDB for storing the data of users and countries, it is really fast, easy to use. In addition, I used #Mongoose for providing schema-based solution to model the application data.
